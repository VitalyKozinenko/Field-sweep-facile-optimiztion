The main script is the PHIP_CPT_Optimal_profile. Operators, ZeemanHam and JHam are functions to initiate spin operators and Hamiltonians with Zeeman and J-coupling correspondingly.
To calcualte the profile just enter the number of spins and J-couplings. Enterring chenical shift values is also possible, however, is does not have much impact of the results.
